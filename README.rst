Weathering the CTA
==================

This is a single-page app + node server API that will display the weather, CTA bus times, and other things what have you.

Installing
----------

To install, clone this repo and then build it::

  npm install
  grunt  # runs grunt webpack sass cssmin

or if you don't have `grunt <https://gruntjs.com>`_ available::

  npm run webpack sass cssmin

Note: I would suggest using ``grunt`` to compile all the ``jsx`` and ``sass`` files. There is a difference between ``cssmin`` from ``npm run`` and from ``grunt cssmin`` that I can't figure out.

Grunt
~~~~~

The `Gruntfile.js <Gruntfile.js>`_ is defined to contain all the tasks that I would normally run to transpile and bundle jsx, compile and minify sass, into a ``dist/`` location. At the moment, there are three commands defined:

- webpack: imports the `webpack.config.js <webpack.config.js>`_ and runs ``webpack``
- sass: uses ``node-sass`` to take ``src/sass`` to ``dist/css``
- cssmin: uses ``cleancss`` to take ``dist/css/*.css``

Webpack
~~~~~~~

The `webpack.config.js <webpack.config.js>`_ is defined to both transpile (ES2016+JSX to ES2015) and bundle (include React/ReactDOM minified source) the `main.jsx <src/main.jsx>`_ file and output it in ``dist/main.js`` which is treated as a static directory served by the express application.

Major Dependencies
------------------

- `express <http://expressjs.com/>`_
- `React <https://facebook.github.io/react/>`_
- `grunt <https://gruntjs.com>`_

  - `webpack <https://webpack.js.org/>`_
  - `node-sass <https://github.com/sass/node-sass>`_
  - `cssmin <https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin>`_

- `cta-bus-tracker <https://github.com/projectweekend/Node-CTA-Bus-Tracker>`_
- (optional) `redis <https://redis.io>`_

Redis is an optional dependency. If you already have a Redis server set up, feel free to switch to API caching using Redis instead of MemoryStore (see `Environment Variables`_ for more information).

Configuration
=============

Configuration is done through environment variables. See the next section for a list of these variables. This can be a little bit tricky to set up for the first time.

We support `dotenv <https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv>`_. The best way to set these environment variables is to create a ``.env`` file in the same directory as this `README.rst <README.rst>`_ file and add a new key/value pair on each line.

Environment Variables
---------------------

===================== ======================================================
Variable              Description
--------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
NODE_ENV              Specify ``production`` or ``development``
CTA_KEY               API key for CTA Bus developer access
DARKSKY_KEY           Dark Sky API key (Free: 1000 requests per day)
REDIS_CACHE           API caching using MemoryStore (``0``) or Redis (``1``)
LAT_LONG              "Latitude,Longitude" of location for weather
===================== ======================================================

DarkSky
~~~~~~~

The configuration for the DarkSky API is pretty straightforward as you feed it a latitude/longitude pair which you can look up using Google Maps or something similar. The key is also grabbed from their website, so make sure you set up an account.

Chicago Transit Authority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This configuration is subtly more complicated. In order to display bus times for stops you want, you need to find the stop identifiers. We provide API routes for this, so when you initially set this up for the first time, you can access specific API endpoints, look up the stop IDs, and then configure this in your environment variables.

Auto-running
============

Forever
-------

Foreverjs is a ridiculously simple tool to ensure that your node server runs... forever. We provide a `forever.config.json <forever.config.json>`_ file that should suit most needs and can be run like::

  forever start ./forever.config.json

In particular, I don't watch for changes since my main use is to put this on a raspberry pi. This means if I want to update it, I just power-cycle and my auto-start script will grab changes and start up the server again with ``forever``. See `Raspberry Pi 3`_ for more information.

Raspberry Pi 3
--------------

An executable ``startup.sh`` script could be written to automatically pull changes, prune packages, install new packages, run grunt, and start a server. An example of such a scrip is provided below for posterity::

  #!/bin/bash
  sleep 8
  # this loads nvm
  export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
  nvm use v5.5.0
  cd /home/pi/weather-the-cta
  /usr/bin/git pull
  npm prune
  npm install
  grunt
  forever cleanlogs # only if you want to clear all historical logs in case they get huge
  forever start ./forever.config.json

This startup script can be executed from ``/home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart``::

  @lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
  @pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
  #@xscreensaver -no-splash  # disable screensaver by commenting out
  @point-rpi
  # stop X11 from turning off automatically
  @xset s off
  @xset -dpms
  @xset s noblank
  @./startup.sh
  @chromium-browser --incognito --kiosk 0.0.0.0:3000

which looks like this for me right now. The log file when this runs on startup is located at ``/home/pi/.cache/lxsession/LXDE-pi/run.log``.
