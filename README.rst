Weathering the CTA
==================

This is a single-page app + node server API that will display the weather, CTA bus times, and other things what have you.

Installing
----------

To install, clone this repo and then build it::

  npm run build

Webpack
~~~~~~~

The `webpack.config.js <webpack.config.js>`_ is defined to both transpile (ES2016+JSX to ES2015) and bundle (include React/ReactDOM minified source) the `main.jsx <src/main.jsx>`_ file and output it in ``dist/main.js`` which is treated as a static directory served by the express application.

Major Dependencies
------------------

- `express <http://expressjs.com/>`_
- `React <https://facebook.github.io/react/>`_
- `webpack <https://webpack.js.org/>`_
- `cta-bus-tracker <https://github.com/projectweekend/Node-CTA-Bus-Tracker>`_
- (optional) `redis <https://redis.io>`_

Redis is an optional dependency. If you already have a Redis server set up, feel free to switch to API caching using Redis instead of MemoryStore (see `Environment Variables`_ for more information).

Environment Variables
=====================

===================== ======================================================
Variable              Description
--------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
NODE_ENV              Specify ``production`` or ``development``
CTA_KEY               API key for CTA Bus developer access
DARKSKY_KEY           Dark Sky API key (Free: 1000 requests per day)
REDIS_CACHE           API caching using MemoryStore (``0``) or Redis (``1``)
LAT_LONG              "Latitude,Longitude" of location for weather
===================== ======================================================

We support `dotenv <https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv>`_. The best way to set these environment variables is to create a ``.env`` file in the same directory as this `README.rst <README.rst>`_ file and add a new key/value pair on each line.
